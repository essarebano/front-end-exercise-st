# Sailthru frontend React exercise

This is a pair programming exercise, you will be assessed based on multiple factors.

**IMPORTANT**, we would like to see how you work and communicate. Make sure to talk about the problems - think of this as a chance to show your knowledge by talking us through why things happen, demonstrate your debugging skills and actively communicate. You may use online resources, feel free to Google something or look up documentation, feel free to ask questions - this is a pair programming exercise!

We evaluate based on many factors, so you are not expected to complete everything - don't stress. TypeScript is optional.

## Instructions

1. The dev server should already be running. It may be useful to open the preview pane in a new browser tab so you have more space to use browser tools.
2. **Oh no there's a problem**, the page is taking ages to load! Use your browser tools to figure out what the problem is.
3. Great job fixing the problem! Now head to `app.js` and implement the features annotated with `TODO`
